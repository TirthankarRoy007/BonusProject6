Simple Order Management System

This is a simple order management system designed to facilitate the creation and tracking of customer orders. The system supports three categories of customers: regular, gold, and platinum. Customers are automatically promoted to higher categories based on the number of orders they have placed. Gold customers receive a 10% discount on their orders, while platinum customers enjoy a 20% discount.
Features

    Order Creation: Customers can create orders, assuming they have already made the full payment. The system does not have order statuses such as created, payment done, or completed. Once an order is created, it is considered final.
    Customer Categories: Customers are categorized as regular, gold, or platinum. By default, customers are regular. Customers are promoted to gold status after placing 10 orders, and to platinum status after placing 20 orders.
    Discount Application: When a customer creates an order, the system automatically applies the appropriate discount based on their category. Gold customers receive a 10% discount, while platinum customers receive a 20% discount.
    Discount Tracking: The system keeps track of the discounts given to each customer and associates them with specific orders. This information allows customers to claim their money back later if necessary.
